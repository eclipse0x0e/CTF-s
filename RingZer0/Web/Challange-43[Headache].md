# Headache
At first it took me 2mins to figure out , then i found out the last challange was about looking Headers to find the flag, When I looked I found the flag.  
### Steps to Flag:
1. Just press _Submit_ with random value for flag
1. Notice the responce headers
1. There will be a header called `Flag:***********`
1. Thats it you found the flag, this was the easy one ever..:D
#### PS:I used the HTTP Spy Chrome extension for this.
