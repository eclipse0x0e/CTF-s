# Area 51
This is kind of intresting, `Access to this area is restricted using some secure .htaccess`   
This tells godo some research on _.htaccess` file    
### Steps to the flag:
1. You need to try all the HTTP request[as of i did]
1. You need to do a `PUT` request to the current challange URL, you can use REST Client extension on Chrome
1. Remember you need to request `PUT` request with your cookies so that the server knows you are doing.
1. Doing it  we get the response as, `<span class="red">AREA 51</span> The origin of the Area 51 name is unclear? Alien?<br /><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">FLAG-*****************</div>						<br />`
1. The flag is visible...,  :D

_This took me some time to figure out.._:sunglasses:
